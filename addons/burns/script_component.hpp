// --- Airway burn (chance from head 2nd/3rd-degree burns -> CBRN airway-inflammation pathway) ---
// Airway burn is BINARY: burned or not, no stacking. On the first successful head-burn roll the airway
// inflammation is set to this fixed severity (0-100); further head burns don't worsen it. The
// breathing-effectiveness penalty in handleUnitVitals reads this value -> serious hypoxia that trends to
// syncope (treated with a cric). Lower this if it deteriorates too fast.
